_spyscope把“#spy/p”等符号置于目标符号之前即可工作，其利用了reader的一个特性：edn tagged literal。_

以下摘自《[the reader](http://clojure.org/reader "clojure's edn tagged elements")》：

> Tagged literals are Clojure's implementation of edn tagged elements.
> 
> When Clojure starts, it searches for files named data_readers.clj at the root of the classpath. Each such file must contain a Clojure map of symbols, like this:
> 
> > {foo/bar my.project.foo/bar
> > 
> >      foo/baz my.project/baz}
> 
> The key in each pair is a tag that will be recognized by the Clojure reader. The value in the pair is the fully-qualified name of a Var which will be invoked by the reader to parse the form following the tag. For example, given the data_readers.clj file above, the Clojure reader would parse this form:
> 
> > \#foo/bar [1 2 3]
> 
> by invoking the Var #'my.project.foo/bar on the vector [1 2 3]. The data reader function is invoked on the form AFTER it has been read as a normal Clojure data structure by the reader.
